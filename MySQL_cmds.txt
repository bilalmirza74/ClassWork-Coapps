Create the orders table:-
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

Insert some sample data into the orders table:-
INSERT INTO orders (order_date, customer_id, total_amount) VALUES
('2024-03-08', 1, 100.50),
('2024-03-09', 2, 75.25),
('2024-03-10', 1, 150.75),
('2024-03-10', 3, 200.00),
('2024-03-11', 2, 50.00),
('2024-03-12', 1, 120.00);

Create the students table:-
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(255),
    course_id INT
);

Query to find the total amount of orders placed by each customer:-
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_orders_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

Insert some sample data into the students table:
INSERT INTO students (student_name, course_id) VALUES
('Mirza', 1),
('Raju', 2),
('Rahul', 1),
('Abood', 3),
('Emaad', 2),
('Raju', 3);

Create the courses table:-
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(255)
);

Insert some sample data into the courses table:-
INSERT INTO courses (course_name) VALUES
('Math'),
('Science'),
('Physics');

Query to list the names of students along with the courses they are enrolled in:-
SELECT s.student_name, c.course_name
FROM students s
JOIN courses c ON s.course_id = c.course_id;
